## Guide

<p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
<p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead.</p>
<p>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours and follows a set of 4 rules to determine the cells status, live or dead.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <p>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</p>
    <image src="/src/assets/examplegif1.gif">
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</p>
    <image src="/src/assets/examplegif2.gif">
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</p>
    <image src="/src/assets/examplegif3.gif">
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p>

#### Getting started

<p>By default a pattern named <strong>Squaredance</strong> will be displayed on screen. Go ahead, click the <strong>start</strong> button!</p>
<p>What happened? If you haven't familiarized yourself with the rules above go ahead and take a moment to digest. Now with the wisdom of the 4 rules here are some additional things to know.</p>

- <p>Essentially, your mouse pointer acts as a paint brush. Without a loaded pattern you can click any single cell within the grid and change its status from alive or dead.</p>
- <p>To remove a loaded pattern you can right click with your mouse or go into settings -> details and click the remove pattern button.</p>
- <p>Some patterns may be too big for your current grid size. Try zooming out! Hold Ctrl+MINUS or Ctrl+MouseScrollDown.</p>
- <p>Patterns within the two folders <strong>WikiCollection & CustomCollection</strong> are sorted by size from smallest to largest.</p>
